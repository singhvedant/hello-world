Practice Repo

Vedant Here, i was wondering if i could add this to the project and not worry about it.
because this is just a experiment branch
i can add anything and review it
if i find ut useful i will add it to the main branch 
if i dont want it....i can just remove it
if any changes take place in the master branch.....it will be changed here too
nice thing for version control
